One of my first projects in Java, created primarily so that I could learn how to use Swing for basic visuals. When cloning this repo and running the project, make sure to place the Images folder in the default or base directory of your project folders. Leftclick on tiles to expose them and rightclick on tiles to place a flag on them. Win detection is based on flagging every mine and only the mines. Loss detection is based on exposing a mine.

The largest change from the first version I made, prior to the recent polish I added, is the change in the explosion animation and the addition of win/loss detection. Changing the explosion animation to instead momentarily swap the images of tiles rather than place images over the tiles sped up the animation and prevented the buffering issues I was experiencing previously.
